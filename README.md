# Pyhton_SnakeGame

Welcome to the classic Snake game, implemented in Python! 
Get ready for a nostalgic journey into the world of pixelated snakes and endless chewing. In this Python version of the game, you guide a hungry snake through a grid and collect delicious treats to grow longer while dodging ever-closer self-collision.
